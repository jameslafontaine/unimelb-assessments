    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the pre-computed text features provided for Project 2. **You do not need to recompute the features yourself for this assignment** -- this information is just for your reference. However, feel free to experiment with different text features if you are interested. If you do want to try generating your own text features, some things to keep in mind:\n",
    "- There are many different decisions you can make throughout the feature design process, from the text preprocessing to the size of the output vectors. There's no guarantee that the defaults we chose will produce the best possible text features for this classification task, so feel free to experiment with different settings.\n",
    "- These features must be trained using a training corpus. Generally, the training corpus should not include validation samples, but for the purposes of this assignment we have used the entire non-test set (training+validation) as the training corpus, to allow you to experiment with different validation sets. If you recompute the text features as part of your own model, you should exclude validation samples and compute them on training samples only. For example, if you do N-fold cross-validation, this means generating N sets of features for N different training-validation splits."

    "A count vectorizer converts documents to vectors which represent word counts. Each column in the output represents a different word and the values indicate the number of times that word appeared in the document. The overall size of a count vector matrix can be quite large (the number of columns is the total number of different words used across all documents in a corpus), but most entries in the matrix are zero (each document contains only a few of all the possible words). Therefore, it is most efficient to represent the count vectors as a sparse matrix."

Most implemementations use around 100-300 dimensions, but the best size depends on the problem you're trying to solve with the embeddings and the number of training samples, so you may wish to try different vector sizes. We provided doc2vec features for Name (vec_size = 100), Authors (vec_size = 20) and Description (vec_size = 100). The vectors themselves represent directions in a high-dimensional concept space; the columns do not represent specific words or phrases. Values in the vector are continuous real numbers and can be negative."
