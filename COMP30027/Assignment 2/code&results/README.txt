To reproduce the predictions, run all cells in COMP30027_2023_asst2_code.ipynb up until and including "Predicting class labels for test sets" to import, preprocess the data and reproduce the kaggle predictions.

Make sure that the csv files and textual feature extraction folders are in the same directory as the .ipynb file

It may take between 30 minutes and an hour to complete all 3 sets of predictions.

The feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation cells may take many hours to fully run if desired.
